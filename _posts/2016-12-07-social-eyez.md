<b>THE PROJECT:</b>  A project that speculates about the possibilities of augmented reality (AR) in a projected future where people's minds will continue to adapt to the presence of digital overload in order to support a greater influx of data, at the cost of their ability to process this information into long term memory. Working in a team of three, we designed "Social-Eyez" - augmented reality contact lenses that assist in face to face social situations by providing users with a wealth of information about their conversation partner as well as visual tools to enable them to use that data to maximum effect. This technology is intended for everyday users who rely on or desire digital assistance during social interactions in order to compensate for a diminished capacity for creativity and deficiency in utilization of long term memory.
